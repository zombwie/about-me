      <h2><span>About me</span></h2>
      <h2>Me</h2> 

        <p>I grew up in Oslo and went to Skøyensåsen school before I came to Kuben. I have one brother and live with my dad. But I also have a couple of cousins, they all live remarkably close so we are often together. When I am not in school, I like to play video games with my friends and code. When I graduate from Kuben I wish to be a programmer just like my father. I have always enjoyed programing and learning new things. To sum it up, I would say I am quite ordinary and an all-around friendly guy to get to know.</p>
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        
        <p>I have been interested in coding my whole life and I started when I was just 12. I know quite a few languages. I know Java, Html, Java script, Python and CSS. I have coded many websites before and I am also quite good at video editing and photo editing with Photoshop and Premiere Pro. I have a lot of experience with Linux and MySQL, from my time running the biggest Norwegian Minecraft server.</p>
        
        <h2>Experience</h2> 
        
        <p>I ran a Minecraft server for a couple of years, I also made my own webstore. I have also made a couple of Java Minecraft plugins.  </p>
